                           EVENT DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE
  * Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can asynchronously
    publish or subscribe to events via a broker/messaging broker.

  * In an event-driven architecture, application communicate by sending messages and / or receiving  events or messages.
  * Event-driven architecture is often referred to as asynchronous communication.
  * Event-driven architecture applications can be created in any programming language because it is a programming approach
    and not a programming language.
  * An event-driven architecture is loosely connected/coupled.

                            ADVANTAGES OF Event Driven Architecture
  * Improves flexibility and maintainability of the applications
  * High scalability and performance
  * Improves availability of the application.
